	<h2>Start of the Day</h2>
		<p>
			After 2nd period i went to ms.Sinclair's, dropped my backpack off and met up with some of my friends. We waited in the lobby for what seemed forever and after that we made it onto the bus. unfortunately we had to have "a buddy" and it broke apart our large group of friends, but it was okay because my partner, Jairo, entertained me the whole time and made it a good bus ride.

	<h2>Arrival</h2>
		<p>
			After our bus dropped us off downtown we had no idea where we were, so our group just followed evreryone hoping that we were going the right way.We ended up walking into a cotton factory,which is wierd, because i didnt excpect that a computer copmany is sbove a cotton museum. Then we had to ride elevators up. I did not want to ride the elevator because i have a phobia of them,once when i was young i got stuck in one and ever since then i just hate them.

	<h2>Speaker</h2>
		<p>
			we got up to the 3rd floor and sat down and listened to some guy speak about programs i have never heard about and stuff we havent learned about.He was so boiring and had the most monotone voice i have ever heard.He was so boring a couple of my friends fell asleep.After he got done talking we went up on a elevator again adn this time we saw a green screen room, which was pretty cool, not going to lie.Most the time the guy was talking i was listening to Playboi Carti.On the way back to the bus was pretty fun, my little group and I had fun.I took some pretty good pictures,which will soon be on my instagram(@suprxssed).

	<h2>On The Way To Food</h2>
		<p>
			On the bus ride to Cookout me and Jairo were so hype because we have never ate there, and we have heard mixed reviews.When we got there, there was a huge line wrapping around the building. While me and jairo were waiting in line we just simply made small talk and showed each other memes. As we got up there and could actually see the menu we both knew exactly what we were getting. I forget what it was called but it was this combo where you got one main dish and 2 sides or 1 side and double your main dish.I got a quesadilla, chicken nuggets, and fries. Jairo got a burger with everything he hated on it so he scaped it all off.

	<h2>Cookout</h2>
		<p>
			We finally got pur food and we finally got seated we took sme funny pictures and mocked girls when they post thier food After we bit in to the food, we fell in love. For a fast food resturant it is actually really good, im pretty sure everyone sitting at my table enjoyed the food. I got so full i gave one of my chicken nuggets and my fries to my homie,Kap. Even though i was so full jairo came back and bought me a piece of cheesecake,which is my favorite dessert, and reguardless of my full stummy,I still ate it. After we got done eating all of our bellies were messed up so we all had to use the bathroom. When Diego and I got up to go tp the bathroom he slipped and fell hard as heck, and I swear it was the funniest thing ever.
